**Background**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is, or the motivation for this feature.

e.g .Some companies have a very high customer concentration risk (eg. TBIG, SUPR, GEMS are examples), and it would be useful to visualize this on the front end

Desired Result
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

e.g. Whenever you go to the stock report of such a company, we should see the yearly breakdown of its customer concentration along with some statistics concerning its customer concentration risk. This should take the form of a visualization, and a simple tabular presentation. Companies with no such concentration risk should not have this component rendered instead of a `<h1>no available data</h1>`.
