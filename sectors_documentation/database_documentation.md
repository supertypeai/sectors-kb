----------------------
This MV compiles peer information for each company to enable comparisons. Peers are identified using IDX-IC classifications in the following hierarchy: sub-industry, industry, sub-sector, and sector. For each company, the dataset includes data from 9 peers plus the company itself. Ranking is determined by grouping companies within the same category (starting from sub-industry, then industry, sub-sector, and sector) and ordering them by market capitalization. The view is refreshed daily at 23:00 (GMT+7).

### Intrinsic Value
This is the detail step how to calculate Intrinsic Value that is available in the [`idx_company_report.intrinsic_value`](#idx_company_report)

**Step 1. Estimate Shares Outstanding**
* Formula:

  $$
  text{Shares Outstanding} = frac{text{Market Cap}}{text{Share Price}}
  $$
* This tells us how many shares the company has issued.

**Step 2. Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
* Take the company’s **Free Cash Flow** from the past 3 years.
* Compute the **average FCF** to smooth out fluctuations.
* This gives a realistic estimate of annual cash flow the business generates.

**Step 3. Discount FCF to Present Value**
* Apply a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model:

  * Project future FCF.
  * Discount those cash flows back to today using a **discount rate** (reflects risk & cost of capital).
  * Add a **terminal value** for cash flows beyond the projection period.

$$
text{Present Value of FCF} = sum frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^t} + text{Terminal Value}
$$

**Step 4. Adjust for Net Debt**
* Net Debt = **Total Debt – Cash**
* Subtracting net debt adjusts the enterprise value into equity value.

**Step 5. Calculate Intrinsic Value per Share**
* Finally, divide by shares outstanding:
$$
text{Intrinsic Value per Share} = frac{text{Present Value of FCF} - text{Net Debt}}{text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$
